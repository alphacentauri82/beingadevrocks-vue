		    <p>Being a DevOps/SysAdmin totally rocks. Being a developer rocks!. Being a Vue Vixen rocks my socks. But why?, don't we all suffer at some point? - probably on a daily basis. I am often seen arguing with my computer and also cheering when things work. It hasn't changed since day one. You won't see a lot of swanky things but here i share my projects and all the reasons that make me love doing what i do! 💜</p>
