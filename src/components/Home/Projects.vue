            </h4>
            <p>Vue Vixens is an initiative founded by Jen Looper, Developer Advocate at Progress, that creates and hosts workshops to teach Vue.js to under-represented people in a cool and fun way. It is based on the successful model pioneered by Shmuela Jacobs for the Angular community (ng-girls.org) who was in turn inspired by the Rails Bridge and Django Girls initiatives. The format involves self-driven code labs completed in a workshop format in groups with mentoring by conference-goers and speakers who volunteer to help. The goal of the program is to familiarize women and those who identify as such with Vue.js in a supportive and inclusive environment. We also help conferences organize their diversity initiatives such as offering free conference tickets, and are building a scholarship fund to help offset those attendees' conference costs so that they can more easily attend.
